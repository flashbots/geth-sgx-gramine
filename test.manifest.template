################################# MOUNT FS ####################################

# General notes:
# - All mount points are mounted using the default 'chroot' type.
# - `path`: names of directories and files in Gramine environment; they may be
#           arbitrary but here we mostly reuse host URIs for simplicity (except
#           for the first `/lib` mount point).
# - `uri`:  names of directories and files on the host, somewhat confusingly
#           prepended by the 'file:' keyword.

  # Mount on-host directory to Gramine glibc/runtime libraries (in 'uri') into
  # in-Gramine visible directory /lib (in 'path').

############################# SGX: TRUSTED FILES ###############################

# Specify all files used by Geth and its dependencies (including all libraries
# which can be loaded at runtime via dlopen), as well as other static read-only
# files (like configuration files).
#
# The paths to files are on-host paths. These files will be searched for in
# in-Gramine visible paths according to mount points above.
#
# As part of the build process, Gramine-SGX script (`gramine-sgx-sign`) finds
# each specified file, measures its hash, and adds it to the manifest entry for
# that file (converting each entry to a table with "uri" and "sha256" keys).
# Note that this happens on the developer machine or a build server. If a
# directory is specified in the list below, then this directory is recursively
# traversed and each found file is processed as described above.
#
# At runtime, during loading of each "trusted file", Gramine-SGX measures its
# hash and compares with the "sha256" value in the corresponding manifest entry.
# If hashes match, this file is trusted and allowed to be loaded and used. Note
# that this happens on the deployment machine.
